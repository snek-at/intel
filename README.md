<h3 align="center">SNEKNetwork for Engineers and Knowledged</h3>
<p align="center">
The SNEK project is an attempt to create a transparent, open-source non-profit platform that allows engineers to categorize and compare. It should enable engineers from adjacent fields to visualize each other's skills through visualization and project identification.
  <br>
This repository serves as an entry point for future packages of the SNEK team.
